# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Update / add the code + tests
3. Update / add documentation as needed
4. Run `make ci`
5. Create pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using the [project's issues](https://github.com/code-gorilla-au/odize/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- expected result
- actual result
- Notes (possibly including what you think might be the root cause)
